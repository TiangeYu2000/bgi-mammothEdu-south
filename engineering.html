                        <p>To achieve a higher and more controllable bioluminescence visible to the naked eye, we
                            designed the project as three
                            Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) cycles. In the first cycle, we increased the concentration of
                            substrates in the caffeic
                            acid cycle using the Tyrosine Ammonia-Lyase (TAL) and p-Coumarate 3-Hydroxylase (C3H) genes,
                            thereby enhancing the
                            brightness of the plant’s bioluminescence, similar to adding more fuel to an engine to make
                            it run faster. In the second
                            cycle, we tested a regulatory module for key catalytic enzymes upstream of the caffeic acid
                            pathway to further increase
                            production, implementing a β-glucuronidase (GUS) staining module to enable the plant to
                            respond to formaldehyde. In the
                            third cycle, we combined the formaldehyde-responsive regulatory module with the enhanced
                            bioluminescence genes, creating
                            a plant that can respond to formaldehyde with increased light emission, much like adding an
                            accelerator pedal to our
                            engine.</p>

                        <p>We have obtained the first-generation stable transgenic line FBP-T2 seeds (also known as
                            FBP-22) of bioluminescent
                            tobacco from a research institution. While this line produces visible bioluminescence, its
                            brightness is still far from
                            meeting practical everyday use requirements [1].</p>
                        <p>Therefore, in this cycle, to enhance the bioluminescence intensity of the FBP-T2/FBP-22 line,
                            we planned to screen
                            upstream pathway genes that increase the substrate concentration in the caffeic acid cycle.
                            After reviewing the
                            literature and mapping the metabolic pathways that could boost the substrate concentration
                            in the caffeic acid cycle, we
                            identified the TAL gene [2] and C3H gene [3]. We constructed overexpression plasmids for
                            these genes and introduced them
                            into Escherichia coli TOP10 for positive monoclonal identification and amplification. The
                            target plasmids were then
                            transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101, followed by positive PCR
                            identification. Using
                            Agrobacterium-mediated transient transformation, we infected tobacco leaves to verify
                            functional expression.</p>

                        <p>The pS1300-GFP (pCAMBIA1300 backbone) vector framework was provided by Mammoth Education Co.,
                            Ltd. The vector was
                            linearized by double digestion with Kpn I and Hind III, followed by purification to obtain
                            the linear plasmid.</p>
                        <p>The sequences for RcTAL, RtTAL (codon optimized), and NoRtTAL (non-codon optimized) were
                            synthesized by BGI LHG and
                            PCR-cloned using the plasmid as a template to obtain PCR products with homologous arms. For
                            AtC3H, CrC3H, NtC3H, PpC3H,
                            RcC3H, and SlC3H, the templates used for the first round of PCR cloning (to obtain PCR
                            products with stop codons) were
                            the cDNA from Arabidopsis thaliana (At), Catharanthus roseus (Cr), Nicotiana tabacum (Nt),
                            Physcomitrium sphaericum
                            (Pp), Rosa spp (Rc), and Solanum lycopersicum (Sl), respectively. A second round of PCR
                            cloning was performed using
                            these PCR products as templates to obtain homologous arm-containing PCR products.</p>
                        <p>Each gene fragment (purified PCR product with homologous arms) was ligated into the
                            linearized vector using seamless
                            cloning (In-Fusion Cloning) techniques. This produced the final verified plasmids,

                        <p>As shown in Figures 1T-1 and 1T-2, the experimental data indicate that all eight experimental
                            groups, which were
                            transiently injected with pS1300-gene-GFP constructs, exhibited varying degrees of higher
                            brightness compared to the
                            control group (injected with only the pS1300-GFP vector). These preliminary results suggest
                            that the successfully
                            constructed TAL and C3H genes can effectively enhance bioluminescence intensity. Among them,
                            the pS1300-RtTAL-GFP
                            injection produced the highest brightness, followed by the pS1300-AtC3H-GFP injection. The
                            phenotypic observation
                            results further confirmed this finding (Figures 1T-3 and 1T-4).</p>

                        <p>Through the transient expression of the eight genes, we concluded that the pS1300-RtTAL-GFP
                            and pS1300-AtC3H-GFP
                            constructs we designed and built can effectively enhance bioluminescence intensity. The
                            phenotypic imaging results
                            showed significantly higher brightness compared to the Control (only injected vector
                            pS1300-GFP) and Blank Control,
                            achieving brighter luminescence than the first-generation lines FBP-T2/FBP-22. These genes
                            play a crucial role in
                            increasing substrate concentrations in the caffeic acid cycle and boosting bioluminescence.
                        </p>
                        <p>Additionally, we conducted multiple tests to extract RNA and obtain cDNA samples from various
                            materials, stages, and
                            parts of ornamental roses, but unfortunately, we were unable to clone RcC3H. During RNA
                            extraction, we observed
                            significant browning of the RNA precipitate, likely due to the high content of secondary
                            metabolites leading to
                            excessive impurities. Attempts to change RNA extraction methods were unsuccessful in
                            reducing the impurity content. Due
                            to time constraints and the availability of sample types, we decided to prioritize more
                            critical tasks and abandon
                            further attempts to obtain the RcC3H gene.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, we have selected the pS1300-RtTAL-GFP and pS1300-AtC3H-GFP vectors for
                            subsequent experimental
                            validation.</p>

                        <p>We aim for the plant to adjust its bioluminescence in response to environmental signals,
                            showcasing the potential of
                            synthetic biology in environmental sensing and response. After enhancing the
                            bioluminescence, we
                            wondered if the plant
                            could detect human emotional fluctuations by sensing gases released through breathing or
                            secretion. However, upon
                            reviewing relevant studies, we found that collecting such gases for experiments is difficult
                            and
                            restricted by Human
                            Subjects Research Policy.</p>
                        <p>As a result, we chose formaldehyde, a common and controllable environmental hazardous gas, as
                            the
                            ideal signal for
                            monitoring. Through literature review and the NCBI database, we identified the promoter
                            sequences for

                            constructed
                            promoter-GUS vectors and
                            used Agrobacterium-mediated transient transformation to verify GUS expression in tobacco

                        <p>We performed transient transformation of tobacco leaves with the blank control (0.5x PBS),

                        <p>As shown in Figure 2T-2, in the blank control group (0.5x PBS), no GUS signal was detected
                            after
                            spraying with either
                            H2O or formaldehyde. In the positive control group (pS1300-GUS), a strong blue GUS signal
                            was
                            observed after both H2O
                            and formaldehyde treatments, with an even deeper blue coloration following formaldehyde
                            application, indicating
                            increased GUS expression.</p>
                        <p>In the experimental group treated with p1300-MDH1-GUS, GUS signals were observed after both
                            H2O
                            and formaldehyde
                            treatments, but the blue coloration was weaker following formaldehyde treatment, and the GUS
                            signal was generally weaker
                            compared to the GUS control group. This suggests that the expression of the MDH1 promoter is
                            inhibited by formaldehyde,
                            though the level of inhibition is not very strong.</p>
                        <p>In the experimental group treated with p1300-GS1-GUS, blue coloration appeared after H2O
                            treatment, but GUS expression
                            was almost completely absent after formaldehyde treatment, indicating that the GS1 promoter
                            is
                            strongly inhibited by
                            formaldehyde.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, in the experimental group treated with p1300-GRF3-GUS, blue coloration was
                            observed
                            after H2O treatment, but
                            no GUS expression was detected after formaldehyde treatment, demonstrating that the GRF3
                            promoter is also inhibited by
                            formaldehyde.</p>

                        <p>The results above indicate that the experimental groups with p1300-promoter-GUS showed
                            significant phenotypic
                            differences. After formaldehyde treatment, the expression of the promoters was inhibited to
                            varying degrees. The
                            p1300-GRF3-GUS group displayed the most pronounced differentiation, with the GRF3 promoter
                            completely inhibiting the
                            expression of the GUS gene in response to formaldehyde treatment, resulting in no
                            blue-stained
                            tissue in the transformed
                            leaves. This outcome aligns with our concept of a formaldehyde-responsive bioluminescence

                            vectors with the
                            formaldehyde-responsive AtGRF3 promoter. This will combine the formaldehyde-responsive

                            bioluminescence enhancement genes, creating a plant that can respond to formaldehyde by
                            adjusting its bioluminescence.

                            post-injection.</p>
                        <p>The results showed that in the control group (pS1300-GFP), the leaves exhibited normal
                            bioluminescence under water
                            treatment, but the bioluminescence intensity was significantly suppressed after formaldehyde
                            treatment, becoming
                            extremely faint (Figure 3T-1). In the experimental group p1300-pGRF3-RtTAL-GFP, after
                            replacing the promoter with GRF3,
                            the leaves displayed normal bioluminescence under water treatment, with intensity noticeably
                            higher than that of the
                            control GFP group, and the bioluminescence intensity remained largely unaffected by
                            formaldehyde treatment. In contrast,
                            the pS1300-RtTAL-GFP control group showed little change in bioluminescence intensity after
                            both water and formaldehyde
                            treatments, with only a slight reduction in brightness following formaldehyde treatment,
                            though still higher than the
                            GFP control group.</p>
                        <p>The results suggest that the GRF3 gene does have some response to formaldehyde, but the
                            difference in bioluminescence
                            intensity is minimal, making it difficult to draw further conclusions.</p>

                        <p>In this experiment using the p1300-pGRF3-RtTAL-GFP vector in response to formaldehyde, the
                            tobacco seedlings used were
                            not at the correct stage for this experiment. The infiltration solution was difficult to
                            inject, resulting in irregular
                            bioluminescent areas and significant leaf stress, which affected both the brightness
                            analysis and visual assessment.
                            Therefore, these results are for reference only. After reflecting on the issues, we
                            conducted a more complete second
                            functional validation.</p>
                        <p>In the p1300-pGRF3-AtC3H-GFP experiment, we observed similar patterns to those found with the
                            pGRF3-RtTAL module. To
                            better illustrate this phenomenon, we used an alternative photography method. As shown in
                            Figure 3T-2, the pS1300-GFP
                            control group was significantly suppressed by formaldehyde, with bioluminescence becoming
                            extremely faint. In the
                            p1300-pGRF3-AtC3H-GFP experimental group, the bioluminescence slightly increased after
                            formaldehyde treatment compared
                            to water treatment. In the pS1300-AtC3H-GFP control group, the brightness remained
                            consistent, with the
                            formaldehyde-treated group showing slightly lower brightness compared to the
                            p1300-pGRF3-AtC3H-GFP group.</p>

                        <p>The GRF3 promoter can respond to formaldehyde and increase the brightness of bioluminescent
                            plants, though the effect is
                            not very pronounced. Additionally, the AtC3H gene allows the plant to maintain near-normal
                            luminescence under
                            formaldehyde inhibition, demonstrating its stability. The results of this experiment were
                            improved by verification
                            across different batches, using tobacco plants grown for a longer period, and directly
                            capturing the bioluminescence of
                            the leaves after injection for clearer visualization.</p>
                        <p>Based on the results of these experiments, we can confirm that the GRF3 promoter does indeed
                            respond to formaldehyde,
                            and both the TAL and C3H genes exhibit high bioluminescence stability. This aligns with our
                            expectations, and we
                            successfully created a bioluminescent plant responsive to formaldehyde. This experiment also
                            validates the feasibility
                            of detecting gas signals released by human emotional fluctuations, such as breathing or
                            secretion, in future studies.</p>
                        <p>However, the formaldehyde used in the experiment caused some damage to the plants, which
                            affected the results. The Super
                            promoter-GUS expression module did not perform as expected, which can be explained by the
                            complexity of overall
                            physiological activity within plants when applying synthetic biology. GUS staining is
                            commonly used for studying
                            promoter expression in plant genes, and our attempt to use it for studying environmental
                            effects on gene expression
                            highlights how it can be influenced by multiple factors, including plant growth and
                            development. These findings provide
                            useful reference points for other teams conducting related experiments. Below, Figure 3L-1
                            shows some explanations we
                            received from online users when seeking help for these issues.</p>

                        <p>In the future, we aim to optimize the expression units of RtTAL and AtC3H by constructing
                            them into a single vector for
                            stable genetic transformation, with the goal of enhancing the brightness of the FBP-T2 line.
                            We will design more refined
                            experimental plans to monitor responses to environmental factors such as formaldehyde or
                            emotional gases in stable plant
                            lines. Additionally, optimizing protein expression and developing male sterility lines will
                            also be important directions
                            for future research.</p>

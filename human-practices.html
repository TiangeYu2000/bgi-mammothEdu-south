                    <h3>Introduction: A Spark in the Night</h3>
                    <div style="text-align: left;">
                        <p>On a serene evening, the BGI-MammothEdu-South team found inspiration in an unexpected place.
                            During a visit to the BGI
                            Time and Space Center, we were captivated by a quietly glowing plant. This was no ordinary
                            tour; it was the moment that
                            ignited our team's vision. Amidst the sparse starlight, the plant emitted a gentle yet
                            steadfast glow, unfolding a
                            splendid scene as if starlight had descended upon the earth. Its leaves swayed softly,
                            whispering a secret: even in the
                            darkest times, hope's light awaits discovery.
                            We realized that life is a continuous cycle of renewal, and we believed that when light and
                            darkness intertwine, the
                            light becomes softer, and the darkness gradually fades—transforming into dawn, hope, and
                            redemption. Inspired by this
                            natural marvel, our team began to ponder: How could we bring this miracle into human life in
                            a way that is both gentle
                            and powerful?</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img class="text_img"
                                src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5218/image/static/images/hp/h1.jpg" alt="h1">
                        </figure>
                        <p>Our team leader, Xingzhu Mu, was deeply moved at that moment. She shared, "Recently, while
                            studying late in the library,
                            I often feel an indescribable loneliness and pressure." Her words resonated with all of us.
                            We recognized that many of
                            our peers were also grappling with similar psychological pressures—exams, internships, and
                            the uncertainties of the
                            future. We wondered if we could create something that would offer solace during these
                            moments of stress.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>After our visit, we gathered to discuss the glowing plant we had seen. The idea emerged:
                            Could we harness this natural
                            wonder to create something that provides emotional support and psychological comfort? Our
                            vision became clear—to create
                            a glowing plant that is not just a decorative piece but a companion offering solace during
                            times of loneliness and
                            anxiety.</p>
                        <div style="text-align: left; color: #a8f900;">
                            <p><b style="color: #a8f900;">Inspiration and Exploration</b>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <p>The healing process of the glowing plant is one of companionship. It thrives under simple
                            conditions and provides a
                            gentle light source, especially at night or during low moods, offering psychological
                            calmness. It creates a tranquil
                            environment, enhances aesthetic feelings, promotes relaxation and meditation, and provides
                            emotional support. By
                            improving the sleeping environment, it effectively heals the mind and alleviates stress. The
                            unique glow not only adds
                            visual comfort in dark environments but also helps people relax and calm down, enhancing
                            overall psychological health
                            and well-being.</p>

                        <p>Our vision was clear: to harness the power of synthetic biology to create a glowing plant
                            that resonates emotionally
                            with people. We believed this plant would become a guardian of the night, a silent healer
                            whose light would illuminate
                            the soul and dispel gloom.</p>

                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <p>In the early stages, we realized that enhancing the brightness of the glowing plant required
                            innovative thinking and
                            continuous iteration. We reached out to Professor Du Hao, a leading figure in synthetic
                            biology at Zhejiang University.
                            In our email, we detailed our team, project focus, and technical route. Professor Du's reply
                            was insightful: "The
                            application of glowing plants is fascinating, but current limitations are due to the
                            intensity of luminescence.
                            Enhancing the brightness is a challenging process, but glowing plants themselves have great
                            potential."</p>

                            <img class="text_img"
                                src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5218/image/static/images/hp/h3.png" alt="h3">
                        </figure>
                        <p>His words prompted us to rethink our approach. We realized that the previously planned C3H
                            pathway might not achieve the
                            desired brightness. Professor Du's suggestions led us to redesign the metabolic pathway to
                            increase luciferin
                            production. Based on his work, we devised a new luminescence enhancement pathway,
                            constructing a TAL pathway to produce
                            more p-coumaric acid, which, through the caffeic acid cycle, would lead to increased
                            luciferin production. This redesign
                            was a significant breakthrough in our project.</p>

                            constructive, and we learned about a
                            biotech company called Light Bio, also focusing on glowing plants.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>To explore clinical applications, we conducted an online interview with Nurse Alex from a
                            psychiatric hospital in the
                            United States. We explained our project's expected outcomes and the roles of dark light
                            therapy and plant therapy. Alex
                            provided valuable insights: "If your glowing plants can achieve the expected healing
                            effect, this would be a novel
                            therapeutic method."</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>We recognized the potential of glowing plants in providing a healing environment for
                            patients with psychological trauma.
                            Alex highlighted that patients with PTSD require environments free from strong light and
                            other stimuli. The soft glow of
                            our plants fits this need perfectly. However, he also cautioned that further clinical
                            trials are necessary to validate
                            therapeutic effects. This interview helped us understand both the potential and
                            limitations of our project in clinical
                            applications.</p>

                            auxiliary tools in psychological
                            therapy. We discussed how they could provide a comfortable healing space for people with

                            gradually taken shape. We have learned to listen, reflect, and quickly adapt to new
                            information and feedback—skills that
                            are crucial to the maturation of our project. Our story is one of continuous progress

                            touch people's hearts, we
                            conducted field research at flower markets. We engaged directly with consumers to understand
                            their perceptions and
                            needs.</p>
                        <p>Consumers showed strong interest in plants that could create a unique atmosphere at home. One
                            customer remarked, "Such a

                        <p>Mr. Xu Hong's work made me realize that our glowing plant pets can become a tool for artistic
                            expression," Li Jinfan
                            shared during the discussion.</p>
                        <p>"Yes, we could host an art workshop and invite community members to create glowing plant
                            artworks together," Xiong Ziye
                            suggested as a specific activity idea.</p>

                        <p>To foster collaboration and communication between research teams involved in synthetic
                            biology, we participated in the
                            “2024 X-Challenge Disruptive Innovation Youth Camp” Gallery Walk, hosted by Shenzhen Zero
                            One Academy, under the
                            guidance of our mentor. This event allowed us to delve into research directions related to
                            synthetic biology, engage in
                            discussions, and share our team's progress on the glowing plant-pet project. We also had
                            meaningful exchanges with
                            participants from previous glowing plant projects and those interested in our work.</p>

                        <p>We participated in the Gallery Walk at the youth camp, where we observed the project
                            presentations from the other
                            participants. During these exchanges, we gained insights into their research directions and
                            were inspired by the
                            imaginative ideas from the high school students. After visiting all the booths, we realized
                            that there was a noticeable
                            lack of representation in biology, especially in synthetic biology. To address this gap and
                            further promote the
                            advancements in synthetic biology among students, our mentors arranged for us to set up a
                            booth in the biology section
                            featuring genetically modified plants.</p>
                        <p>By setting up our display, we quickly immersed ourselves in the academic atmosphere of the
                            Gallery Walk. We shared our
                            posters and project concepts with high school students and passersby, explaining the concept
                            of PetalGlow and the future
                            potential of genetically modified plants. During the presentation, we received many
                            questions about PetalGlow, such as
                            how to enhance the plant’s brightness, how to design controls to compare light intensity,
                            which plants could be made to
                            glow, and whether PetalGlow could be commercialized. These questions were closely related to
                            the challenges we were
                            already addressing in our project, providing us with valuable insights into the public's
                            interests and concerns, which
                            helped to further refine our research direction.</p>

                        <p>The event reached its peak when our team leader guided everyone through a comprehensive
                            presentation of our project’s
                            concept, experimental progress, product prospects, and future directions. This allowed the
                            audience to gain a deeper
                            understanding of our project. The enthusiastic feedback from the audience confirmed the
                            novelty and appeal of the
                            PetalGlow concept, strengthening our belief in the practical value of our research. It also
                            inspired the students of
                            Zero One Academy in their own research fields. Members of the Track 5 team from the 2023
                            summer school, Chen Tanghao and
                            Jin Borui, extended the conversation with us by sharing their work on glowing plants from
                            the previous year, which
                            helped us further expand our project’s direction.</p>

                        <p>We also gained inspiration for creating a game to promote and market our project.
                            Incorporating PetalGlow into a game
                            had been an idea we wanted to pursue, but we were unsure of how to proceed. Through the
                            Track 6 "Biological Interaction
                            Game" session, where students created a slime mold-themed game, we learned about the game
                            development process and the
                            expected outcomes. This provided us with valuable references for creating our own game. We
                            also realized that using
                            games could significantly capture the audience’s attention and boost the visibility of our
                            product, helping to introduce
                            the PetalGlow concept to a wider audience.</p>

                                <p>In our game, the structural models of caffeic acid and p-coumaric acid, which are key
                                    components in the bioluminescence
                                    pathway, serve as points. These models are randomly generated by the background and
                                    Arabidopsis thaliana plants, worth
                                    15 and 10 points, respectively. The game offers both day and night modes for players
                                    to choose from. The day mode is
                                    common, and if the night mode is
                                    selected, the brightness of the caffeic acid and p-coumaric acid models will be
                                    enhanced. Our game also features six plant species used in our experiments.
                                    Arabidopsis
                                    thaliana functions by producing p-coumaric
                                    acid and requires 15 points to plant. Tobacco can withstand 10 zombie attacks and
                                    costs 45 points. Physcomitrella patens
                                    and Catharanthus roseus can both shoot C3H proteinsto attack zombies, costing
                                    30 and 60 points respectively, and
                                    inflicting 10 and 20 zombie's HP of damage per hit. The Tomato Bomb can eliminate
                                    zombies within the explosion radius
                                    and costs 75 points, while the Rose functions similarly to tobacco but can withstand
                                    20 zombie attacks, costing 90
                                    points. You win the game after successfully defending against 25 zombies.
                                    Conversely, if all
                                    plants in a row and the target
                                    plants are eaten by zombies, the game is lost.</p>

                        <p>Key Takeaways:</p>
                        <p>1. We gained insights into other biology-related research topics and progress, which helped
                            us clarify the next steps in
                            our research, particularly focusing on enhancing brightness and exploring different types of
                            glowing plants.</p>
                        <p>2. We successfully promoted PetalGlow and gathered data on its acceptance among students,
                            which helped us understand the
                            public’s main expectations and concerns. We learned that PetalGlow has great market
                            potential, though ensuring the
                            safety of the product is paramount.</p>
                        <p>3. We explored the feasibility of using a game as a tool for promoting the project, which
                            provided a valuable reference
                            model for our game design.</p>
                        <p>Conclusion:</p>
                        <p>During this event, we systematically introduced the concept of PetalGlow, our experimental
                            progress, product prospects,
                            and future directions. We were pleasantly surprised by the overwhelmingly positive feedback
                            from the audience, which
                            even sparked ideas for further research and integration with synthetic biology in their own
                            fields. After our
                            presentation, members of the Track 5 team from the 2023 summer school extended the
                            conversation with us, sharing their
                            previous work on glowing plants, which led to further discussions and collaboration. The
                            strong audience interest
                            confirmed the novelty and appeal of PetalGlow, reinforcing our confidence in the practical
                            value of our research. This
                            experience demonstrated that we had effectively introduced synthetic biology and glowing
                            plants to a wider audience,
                            successfully expanding public knowledge and awareness.</p>

                        <p>Expert Interaction:</p>
                        <p>During the Q&A session, we were met with a question from Dr. Shen Yue of the University of
                            Edinburgh, who inquired about
                            how we ensure the biosafety of the glowing plants. Our response not only showcased our
                            thoughtful consideration of the
                            project but also reflected our respect for scientific ethics.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>“When Dr. Shen Yue acknowledged our project, I felt incredibly proud. Our hard work has
                            finally been recognized by
                            international experts,” said Mu Xingzhu excitedly after the presentation.</p>
                        <p>“Yes, it’s not just a recognition of our work but also a testament to our team spirit,” Li
                            Jinfan added.</p>
                        <p>As the ICG Conference concluded successfully, our project embarked on a new starting point.
                            Our Human Practices efforts
                            added value to the project and gave it deeper social significance. Our project won the
                            "Biomanufacturing’s Best Oral
                            Presentation Award" at the conference, which was a great acknowledgment of our work. This
                            experience brought our team
                            members closer together and boosted their confidence, allowing our story—and our plants—to
                            shine brightly on the
                            international stage. We plan to continue optimizing our glowing plant pets to better meet
                            market demands and user
                            expectations. We will also explore more collaborative opportunities to bring our project to
                            an even broader stage.</p>

                    <h3>Epilogue: An Ending is Also a Beginning</h3>
                    <div style="text-align: left;">
                        <p>In today’s world, the relationship between humanity and nature is being reshaped. Human
                            civilization, in its pursuit of
                            progress, continually disrupts the natural order. In the long run, this not only harms
                            nature but also serves as a slow
                            poison to humanity itself. In modern society, we are losing our primal essence, leading to
                            feelings of boredom, anxiety,
                            depression, and numbness—deep and lasting damage to each individual within human society.
                            However, through synthetic
                            biology, we actively modify plants that originate from nature, and this modification is
                            positive and constructive.
                            Nature nurtures humanity and grants us the ability to transform the world around us; by
                            altering plants, we ultimately
                            enable them to have the potential to change us in return.</p>
                        <p>We warmly invite you to join us in this luminous journey. Let's illuminate the path toward a
                            brighter future together.</p>

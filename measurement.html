                        <p>In this project, by recording the growth cycle of Nicotiana benthamiana, we assisted the
                            functional validation team in
                            preparing for the optimal period of tobacco transient infection. To accurately determine the
                            suitable injection period,
                            we watered the plants with a fixed amount of water every other day while maintaining
                            consistent environmental
                            conditions. We measured the daily changes in leaf length and plant height after
                            transplantation, with individual
                            measurements taken for each leaf. Each group had three replicates, and two batches of
                            seedlings were used in the
                            experiments. The raw data can be found in the Excel spreadsheet.</p>
                        <p>For data analysis, we processed missing and outlier values using Excel. The preprocessed data
                            was organized into line
                            charts to visualize trends, and final effect plots were provided.</p>
                        <p>Our measurement tools offered the functional validation team more precise time points for
                            processing, enabling accurate
                            prediction of the optimal time window to prepare infection samples.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>During the seedling cultivation period, we observed the following: 1. As shown in the raw
                            data in the Excel sheet below,
                            many leaves were still in the budding stage in the early period, so no growth records were
                            taken; only significant
                            growth was recorded later. 2. In the later growth records, some bottom leaves exhibited
                            slowed growth, fluctuations in
                            leaf length, and even wrinkling, which could be due to mild dehydration or the plant
                            sacrificing nutrients from the
                            lower leaves to support the growth of the upper leaves. 3. After more than four days of
                            recording, the growth slope of
                            newly emerged leaves was significantly steeper than that of the older leaves, indicating
                            that the new leaves grew much
                            faster than the older ones. This may have a beneficial effect on plant growth (apical
                            dominance).</p>

                        <p>Due to the growth of the leaves, the gravity of the leaves will lower the height of the
                            plant, and the contact with the
                            plant during measurement may change the height of the plant, so the plant height here is
                            unstable and there is a large
                            fluctuation.</p>
                        <p>According to the chart, the plant height was generally slower in the early stage. The first
                            and second batches both had
                            large fluctuations in plant height between August 8 and August 14. Because the first batch
                            and the second batch were not
                            planted at the same time, the tobacco should be affected by environmental factors, and
                            therefore, the instability of
                            plant height makes plant height not a standard to measure the development of tobacco.</p>

                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <p>In plant experiments, we typically use Agrobacterium-mediated transient transformation of
                            tobacco leaves for rapid
                            functional validation. When infecting leaves, older leaves are generally not selected under
                            non-specific conditions for
                            the following reasons:</p>
                        <p>1. Cell Activity: Older leaves have lower cell activity and reduced metabolic activity, which
                            are not conducive to the
                            expression of foreign genes and reduce transformation efficiency.</p>
                        <p>2. Tissue Structure: Older leaves have thicker cell walls and a harder texture, which may
                            hinder the transfer and
                            absorption of foreign DNA, reducing transformation efficiency.</p>
                        <p>3. Health Condition: Older leaves may harbor more pathogens or be more affected by
                            environmental stress, making them
                            less healthy than younger leaves, which could impact the accuracy of experimental results.
                        </p>
                        <p>4. Physiological State: Younger leaves are in a physiological state more suitable for gene
                            expression and protein
                            synthesis, enhancing the effectiveness of transient expression.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, selecting younger leaves for transient transformation experiments in tobacco can
                            improve transformation
                            efficiency and gene expression levels, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the
                            experimental results.</p>
                        <p>To determine the optimal injection period for younger leaves, our data analysis indicated
                            that around the third week
                            (approximately 16 days) after transplanting is suitable for preparing infection solutions
                            and conducting bacterial
                            culture shaking. We then performed transient injections at various growth stages of the
                            tobacco seedlings, finding
                            notable differences between early-stage new leaves and mature leaves (26 days after
                            germination) at the injection stage.</p>
                        <p>Compared to younger leaves, mature tobacco leaves are fully expanded, have smoother surfaces,
                            and clearly defined veins
                            with fewer small veins, allowing a single injection to spread the infection solution over a
                            larger area, often covering
                            more than one-third of the leaf area, thereby reducing the number of injections needed. In
                            contrast, immature leaves are
                            not fully smooth, sometimes exhibiting uneven surfaces and numerous fine veins, making
                            injection more challenging and
                            resulting in a smaller spread area per injection, often not exceeding a 2 cm diameter
                            circle. This necessitates multiple
                            injections. Under these conditions, using overly young leaves for injection, such as when
                            comparing luminescence
                            differences, causes significant damage to the leaves and greatly affects the accuracy and
                            stability of functional
                            validation results.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, it is advisable to schedule bacterial culture shaking and infection solution
                            preparation around the third
                            week (approximately 16 days) after transplanting, with infection and phenotypic observation
                            conducted one month from the
                            initial sterilization treatment.</p>

                    <h3>Product Description</h3>
                    <div style="text-align: left;">
                        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted mental health worldwide, contributing to a 25%
                            increase in anxiety,
                            depression, and stress (WHO, 2022). In China, these challenges are particularly severe,
                            exacerbated by the relentless
                            pressure of neijuan—a cultural phenomenon where societal norms and self-imposed competition
                            drive individuals to work
                            harder, often at the expense of their well-being.</p>
                        <p>One of the first casualties of this unrelenting stress is sleep. Anxiety disrupts the ability
                            to relax, leading to
                            difficulties in falling asleep (Dusang, 2019). Traditional night lights, which many rely on
                            for comfort, can
                            inadvertently worsen this problem by interfering with melatonin production—the hormone
                            essential for regulating sleep.
                            Exposure to light before bed can suppress melatonin levels, making it harder to fall asleep
                            and intensifying the cycle
                            of stress and anxiety (Zlatina Nenchovska et al., 2022).</p>
                        <p>Recognizing these challenges, PetalGlow was designed to offer a unique and holistic approach
                            to mental well-being. At
                            daytime, PetalGlow incorporates the therapeutic benefits of horticultural therapy. It
                            arrives as a young plant, ready to
                            grow under your care. Daily tasks like watering and caring for PetalGlow's growth create a
                            mindful routine that
                            alleviates mild anxiety and stress, promotes relaxation, and enhances mood (Lu et al.,
                            2023).</p>
                        <p>As night falls, PetalGlow takes its therapeutic effects a step further by emitting a soft,
                            calming bioluminescent light
                            that creates an ideal pre-sleep environment. Unlike harsh night lights, PetalGlow’s subtle
                            glow provides just enough
                            illumination to ease you into a restful state without disrupting the darkness needed for
                            sleep.</p>
                        <p>PetalGlow can't eliminate the stress and pressures of daily life, but it can provide a
                            soothing escape. Through the
                            therapeutic routine of caring and calming bioluminescent light, PetalGlow helps you unwind,
                            promoting relaxation and
                            better sleep. As a gift, it’s a thoughtful way to bring a touch of peace and tranquility
                            into the lives of those you
                            care about.</p>

                    <h3>Product Function</h3>
                    <div style="text-align: left;">
                        <p>PetalGlow works in two distinct ways to support mental well-being:</p>
                        <p>1. Daytime Horticultural Therapy:
                            During the day, PetalGlow harnesses the proven benefits of horticultural therapy. Studies
                            show that engaging with plant
                            care activities, such as watering and nurturing a plant, can reduce stress and promote
                            mental well-being. PetalGlow
                            arrives as a young plant, ready to be cared for, allowing users to create a daily routine
                            that provides a sense of
                            accomplishment and calm (Lu et al., 2023). This therapeutic engagement helps mitigate
                            anxiety throughout the day.</p>
                        <p>2. Nighttime Bioluminescent Light:
                            At night, PetalGlow serves as a gentle replacement for artificial lights, which are known to
                            interfere with melatonin
                            production and disrupt sleep (Falcón et al., 2020). The soft bioluminescent light emitted by
                            PetalGlow creates a
                            soothing pre-sleep environment. This natural light promotes relaxation and reduces anxiety,
                            helping users to drift off
                            more easily. Unlike traditional night lights that suppress melatonin and exacerbate sleep
                            issues, PetalGlow’s glow is
                            gentle enough to complement the body’s natural circadian rhythms.</p>

                <section id="customers">
                    <h3>Potential Customers</h3>
                    <div style="text-align: left;">
                        <p>Our primary target customers are individuals seeking unique living companions and innovative
                            ways to enhance their
                            pre-sleep environment. PetalGlow's soothing bioluminescence and natural characteristics make
                            it an optimal solution for
                            both functional use and decorative appeal. Based on survey results (Figure 1), 81% of
                            respondents expressed interest in
                            using PetalGlow to improve their sleep environment, with over 68% recognizing the potential
                            benefits of bioluminescent
                            light in aiding sleep. Based on the study, we have identified key customer groups who are
                            most likely to be drawn to
                            PetalGlow:</p>
                        <p>Plant lovers: These individuals will find PetalGlow’s bioluminescent properties particularly
                            appealing, as this
                            feature is not found in natural plants, offering a unique addition to their collection.</p>
                        <p>Adults aged 18-30: This demographic faces significant stress from career and social
                            pressures. Studies show that 19.5%
                            of adults aged 18-29 exhibit anxiety symptoms, making PetalGlow a fitting tool to alleviate
                            anxiety and improve mood
                            through its calming light and the therapeutic experience of plant care.</p>
                        <p>Innovative product enthusiasts: People interested in cutting-edge products are likely to be
                            attracted to PetalGlow’s
                            fusion of genetic engineering and natural aesthetics.</p>

                                    pre-sleeping environment, indicating strong consumer demand for natural, calming
                                    light solutions like bioluminescent
                                    plants.
                                    (B) A significant proportion of respondents (68%) believe that the bioluminescent
                                    light from PetalGlow would help them
                                    fall asleep, reinforcing the product’s potential as an alternative to traditional
                                    night lights.</p>

                            transitions, examinations, or
                            personal challenges may seek ways to relax and create a serene home environment. PetalGlow
                            offers a non-invasive method

                        <p>Given PetalGlow’s versatility and appeal across various contexts—from personal use to special

                            well-positioned to tap into several growing markets. These markets are seeing substantial
                            growth due to shifting
                            consumer preferences towards unique, personalized products that offer both functionality and
                            emotional value.</p>
                        <p>Gift Market: The global gift market is projected to grow significantly in the coming years.
                            According to China Daily
                            Global, in 2022, the overall scale of China's gifts industry reached 1.23 trillion yuan,
                            with the annual growth rate
                            exceeding 9 percent from 2018 to 2022. Projections anticipate an average growth rate of 4
                            percent between 2023 and 2027
                            (Wang, 2024). This phenomenon is driven by trends toward personalization and the rising
                            demand for unique and thoughtful
                            gifts. PetalGlow, as a novel product, fits well within this market, especially in regions
                            like China, where gifting is
                            an important cultural tradition.</p>
                        <p>Wellness and Mental Health Products: In compliance with Straits Research, the global mental
                            wellness market size was
                            valued at USD 147.07 billion in 2022. It is estimated to reach USD 251.65 billion by 2031,
                            growing at a CAGR of 6.15%
                            during the forecast period (Straits Research, 2023). This suggests that the mental wellness
                            market has seen rapid
                            expansion, fueled by a heightened focus on mental health, especially in the post-pandemic
                            era. As more people seek
                            natural, non-invasive ways to reduce stress and improve sleep, PetalGlow is ideally
                            positioned to capture a significant
                            share of this growing sector.</p>
                        <p>Home Décor Market: According to analysis, China's home decor market is projected to reach
                            around US$28.83 billion by
                            2027, with a forecasted CAGR growth of 9.26% from 2023 to 2027 (David M, 2023). With an
                            increasing emphasis on home
                            décor, particularly as people spend more time at home, demand for products that blend beauty
                            with functionality is
                            rising. In China alone, the home décor market is expected to experience substantial growth,
                            providing PetalGlow a strong
                            entry point as both a decorative and therapeutic product.</p>

                        <p>Night lights provide comfort but often emit bright light that disrupts sleep by suppressing
                            melatonin production,
                            leading to poor sleep quality and increased stress (Falcón et al., 2020; Cho et al., 2013).
                            They offer safety but don't
                            address underlying sleep issues.</p>
                        <p>PetalGlow emits a soft bioluminescent light that is gentle on the eyes and less likely to
                            interfere with sleep. By
                            creating a calming environment and combining light benefits with horticultural therapy,
                            PetalGlow alleviates mild
                            anxiety and improves sleep, offering a holistic alternative to traditional night lights.</p>
                        <p>The night light market is expected to grow to $388.07 million by 2031, driven by rising
                            demand in commercial and
                            residential sectors (Business Research Insight, 2024). The Asia Pacific region, particularly
                            China, is projected to lead
                            this growth (Patel, 2019). As the market expands, PetalGlow represents an emerging niche for
                            health-conscious consumers
                            seeking products that combine functionality with mental health benefits, positioning it as a

                            appealing to those who prioritize both health and innovation in their home decor.</p>
                        <p>PetalGlow also improves indoor air quality and has a lower carbon footprint compared to night

                        <p>PetalGlow offers a natural, side-effect-free solution for mild anxiety by combining
                            bioluminescent light and
                            horticultural therapy to create a calming environment that supports sleep and relaxation.
                            Unlike melatonin, which
                            primarily targets sleep disturbances and can cause side effects like drowsiness, headaches,
                            and nausea (NHS, 2023), or
                            antidepressants prescribed for moderate to severe anxiety with potential side effects and
                            dependency risks
                            (Healthdirect, 2023), PetalGlow integrates seamlessly into daily life without medical

                        <p>As a living, growing companion, PetalGlow flourishes under your care, creating a personal

                        <p>In summary, PetalGlow is a safer alternative to melatonin and antidepressants for managing

                            conventional plants. Its
                            bioluminescence sets it apart in the vast ornamental plant market, aligning with the growing
                            interest in innovative home

                        <p>To commercialize PetalGlow in the U.S., based on the process followed by Light Bio, PetalGlow
                            would need to first
                            undergo a Regulatory Status Review (RSR) with the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection
                            Service (APHIS) to assess
                            any potential plant pest risks. APHIS would evaluate the genetic modifications, particularly
                            the bioluminescence trait,
                            to determine if PetalGlow poses any environmental or pest-related risks. If approved,
                            PetalGlow could be granted
                            non-regulated status under 7 CFR part 340, allowing production and breeding without further
                            federal oversight. Since
                            PetalGlow is ornamental, FDA and EPA involvement is expected to be minimal, though FDA
                            labeling requirements may apply
                            if there are significant differences in safety or allergenicity. Compliance with
                            state-specific GMO regulations for
                            production and sales permits would also be required.</p>
                        <p>In China, where there are no specific laws governing genetically modified ornamental plants,
                            we must refer to
                            agricultural GMO regulations such as "Regulations on the Safety Management of Agricultural
                            Genetically Modified
                            Organisms" for guidance. According to these regulations, since the recipient organism,
                            genetic modification, and
                            production activity of PetalGlow indicate no significant risk to the environment and human,
                            it would likely be
                            classified as Safety Level I. The genetic modification would undergo thorough laboratory
                            testing, including gene
                            expression analysis, toxicity testing, and allergenicity evaluation, to assess its impact on
                            the environment and
                            non-target organisms. After passing these tests, the product would proceed to intermediate
                            trials under controlled
                            conditions, followed by environmental release trials to ensure it does not negatively affect
                            the environment. Upon
                            successful completion, PetalGlow can apply for an Agricultural GMO Safety Certificate, after
                            which it must comply with

                        <p>In our project, we referenced the male sterility mechanism described in iGEM part
                            BBa_K1554004 to prevent the spread of
                            genetic material through pollen. This mechanism utilizes the TA29 promoter, which is a
                            specific promoter to the tapetum
                            tissue in plant's anthers (the part of the flower that produces pollen). The TA29 promoter
                            controls the expression of
                            barnase, a gene that codes for a ribonuclease, which is specifically expressed in the
                            anthers. During the plant's flower
                            development, the TA29 promoter triggers the expression of barnase, causing death of cells
                            responsible for pollen
                            formation, thereby leading to male sterility. This approach effectively prevents the
                            dissemination of genetically
                            modified traits through natural reproduction, contributing to biosafety measures (IGEM

                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <p>To ensure scalability and adherence to realistic timelines, PetalGlow’s development plan will
                            be structured in several
                            key phases:</p>
                        <p>1. Initial R&D (2-3 months):</p>
                        <p>The foundation of PetalGlow’s bioluminescent trait will be developed through advanced genetic
                            engineering, specifically
                            by enhancing caffeic acid synthesis. This phase will involve close collaboration between
                            genetic engineers, who will
                            design and test the bioluminescent modifications. Horticultural experts will ensure that the
                            genetically modified plants
                            can thrive under different environmental conditions, making them suitable for consumer use.
                            During this period, mental
                            health professionals will be consulted to explore how the bioluminescent effect could
                            enhance therapeutic benefits, such
                            as reducing anxiety and improving sleep quality. Additionally, safety testing will be
                            conducted to ensure that the
                            modifications align with global safety standards for genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Safety Testing & Regulatory Compliance (3-6 months):</p>
                        <p>During this phase, PetalGlow will undergo rigorous safety testing to comply with GMO safety
                            regulations in each target
                            market. The genetic engineering team will continue to work closely with regulatory agencies
                            to ensure that the product
                            meets the necessary GMO safety certifications, such as the Agricultural GMO Safety
                            Certificate in China. Additionally,
                            horticultural experts will contribute to obtaining phytosanitary certifications for global
                            shipments by ensuring the
                            plants can survive international transport without carrying pests or diseases. The combined
                            efforts of marketing and
                            sales teams will also focus on transparent labeling to mitigate any concerns related to
                            GMOs, especially through clear
                            communication with regulatory bodies.</p>
                        <p>3. Market Launch (6-12 months):</p>
                        <p>Once safety and regulatory approvals are in place, PetalGlow will launch on its official
                            e-commerce platform, alongside
                            other popular online marketplaces. The marketing and sales teams will play a crucial role
                            during this phase by
                            developing educational campaigns that inform consumers about the product’s therapeutic
                            benefits. Mental health
                            professionals will be integral in validating these benefits, ensuring that the marketing
                            materials accurately reflect
                            the product’s potential to reduce anxiety and improve sleep. Horticultural experts will
                            develop plant care guides to be
                            included with each purchase, ensuring that consumers have the information needed to care for
                            their plants properly.
                            These combined efforts will help establish a positive perception of the product and address
                            any potential concerns
                            regarding GMOs.</p>
                        <p>3.1 Pricing Strategy:</p>
                        <p>Considering PetalGlow’s production costs and market positioning, we estimate an appropriate
                            retail price for the
                            product. The average cost of a glass vase on platforms like Taobao is around 20 RMB (about
                            $2.8 USD). Based on pricing
                            from Kunming International Flora Auction Trading Center, a traditional rose costs between
                            1.5 to 2 RMB (approximately
                            $0.2 to $0.3 USD) per flower. However, PetalGlow is a genetically modified bioluminescent
                            plant, and due to efficient
                            production methods and low labor costs in China, the production cost per plant is estimated
                            to be around 5 RMB
                            (approximately $0.7 USD) or even lower.
                            Adding the cost of high-quality packaging, which is estimated at 5 RMB (approximately $0.7
                            USD), the total production
                            cost per unit is broken down as follows:</p>

                            <li style="font-size: clamp(0.5rem, 1.25vw, 1rem); ">Lower Estimate: 30 RMB × 2 = 60 RMB
                                (about $8.4 USD)
                            </li>
                            <li style="font-size: clamp(0.5rem, 1.25vw, 1rem); ">Upper Estimate: 30 RMB × 2.5 = 75 RMB
                                (about $10.5 USD)
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>Pricing PetalGlow between 60 and 75 RMB positions it as an affordable luxury item, making it
                            accessible to a broad
                            customer base while reflecting its unique value proposition. This price range is competitive
                            compared to premium flowers
                            and decorative plants available in the market and ensures a healthy profit margin to cover
                            other operational expenses
                            such as marketing, distribution, and customer service. It is important to note that this
                            estimation excludes research
                            and development costs, focusing solely on production and operational expenses to determine a
                            feasible retail price.</p>
                        <p>4. Scaling & Expanding Product Line (12+ months):</p>
                        <p>After a successful market launch, PetalGlow will begin to expand its product line with
                            additional plant varieties and a
                            subscription service for regular plant deliveries. Genetic engineers will continue to

                        <p>5. Risks and Mitigation:</p>
                        <p>GMO Perception: Public concerns about the safety of GMOs are a potential risk. To address
                            this, the marketing and sales
                            teams will prioritize clear labeling and transparency. Educational campaigns developed in
                            collaboration with genetic
                            engineers and mental health professionals will provide scientifically backed information to
                            reassure customers.</p>
                        <p>Regulatory Challenges: Navigating the complex regulations of various countries, particularly
                            in China, can pose a risk.
                            Close collaboration between the genetic engineering team and regulatory bodies will be
                            essential for meeting safety and
                            compliance standards in each market, avoiding delays.</p>
                        <p>Customer Engagement: Continuous customer interaction will be critical for the product’s
                            long-term success. The marketing
                            and sales teams will develop a community platform that provides resources for plant care and
                            therapeutic benefits,
                            fostering long-term customer loyalty.</p>

                    <h3>Intellectual Property and Risk Management</h3>
                    <div style="text-align: left;">
                        <p>Given the risk that counterfeiters might engage in unauthorized cultivation of PetalGlow and
                            illegally sell subsequent
                            generations, we must implement male sterility measures to prevent piracy and ensure
                            PetalGlow does not spread
                            uncontrollably. In our project, we referenced the male sterility mechanism described in iGEM
                            part BBa_K1554004 to
                            prevent the spread of genetic material through pollen. This is crucial for protecting our
                            intellectual property and
                            complying with regulatory standards. By ensuring PetalGlow cannot be reproduced without
                            authorization, we can better
                            control the product’s distribution and protect the brand name.</p>
                        <p>One of the primary risks for PetalGlow lies in potential market resistance to GMOs, with
                            consumer concerns ranging from
                            safety and environmental impacts to ethical issues. Some individuals may prefer natural
                            houseplants, which are widely
                            accepted and free from these concerns, even though they do not provide the same nighttime
                            therapeutic effects as
                            PetalGlow. This resistance could hinder market adoption and growth.</p>
                        <p>However, our survey results show a more favorable stance toward GMOs: 55.56% of respondents
                            were neutral, 42.22%
                            supported or strongly supported GMOs, and only 2.22% expressed opposition. These figures
                            suggest that the actual
                            resistance is not as widespread as might be feared, meaning that selling PetalGlow is quite
                            feasible given the
                            majority’s neutral or positive stance. To further mitigate this risk, our primary strategy
                            will focus on education to
                            dispel misconceptions and biases against GMOs. By providing clear, evidence-based
                            information about the safety,
                            environmental benefits, and effectiveness of PetalGlow, we aim to reduce the influence of
                            any false beliefs or unfounded
                            fears. This targeted educational effort will help build consumer trust and acceptance,
                            ensuring a smoother path to
                            market success.</p>

                                GMOs remains a significant challenge. Despite PetalGlow’s safety and compliance
                                with GMO regulatory standards, some consumers may be hesitant to adopt genetically
                                modified products. Clear, transparent
                                communication about the benefits and safety of PetalGlow, coupled with educational
                                campaigns, will be crucial to
                                addressing these concerns and building trust among potential customers.

                    <h3>Why Education？</h3>
                    <div style="text-align: left;">
                        <p>Synthetic biology, hailed as the third biotechnological revolution following the discovery of
                            the "DNA double helix
                            structure" and "genome technology," has gained significant attention. But do ordinary people
                            truly understand and
                            recognize its significance? In middle school textbooks, the remarkable achievements of
                            synthetic biology are merely
                            glossed over, as if they have no relevance to middle school students. However, after our
                            team delved into the principles
                            of synthetic biology, we realized that its core is not overly complex. With the right
                            approach to science education,
                            middle school students can easily comprehend synthetic biology. Therefore, we decided to
                            conduct a series of educational
                            activities aimed at middle school students in Shenzhen, bringing more of them into the world
                            of synthetic biology.
                            On this foundation, we can further promote the knowledge of synthetic biology and glowing
                            plants to the general public,
                            ensuring that this knowledge expands and deepens through continuous exchange and
                            dissemination. Our educational project,
                            centered around glowing plants, aims to fill the public's knowledge gap in the field of
                            synthetic biology. Through
                            offline presentations and other activities, learners of different ages can personally
                            experience the scientific
                            principles behind glowing plants. These activities not only spark interest in biotechnology
                            among participants but also
                            raise their awareness of sustainable development issues.
                            Through the power of education, we hope to inspire more people to engage in scientific
                            exploration and together build a
                            greener and more innovative future. We believe that with these efforts, we can not only
                            ignite the curiosity of the next
                            generation of scientists but also enhance the public's understanding and support of
                            technological innovation, ultimately
                            driving society toward a more sustainable and inclusive direction.</p>

                    <h3>Preperation</h3>
                    <div style="text-align: left;">
                        <p>We believe that education is the re-output of knowledge after it has been absorbed.
                            Therefore, the key to our
                            preparation lies in enriching our own knowledge base as much as possible. All iGEM
                            participants understand the
                            importance of laboratory safety and bioethics, as this is not just a technical issue but the
                            fundamental foundation of
                            all scientific research and experimental activities.</p>
                        <p>We decided to learn from professionals and summarize the knowledge we acquired into segments
                            that can be easily shared
                            with others. To achieve this, we invited Ms. Wenni from the BGI Research Institute and Ms.
                            Weili Zhou from BGI’s
                            Bioethics Office to provide our team with lectures and training focused on bioethics and
                            biosafety.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Afterward, we summarized the knowledge we gained into the "Biosafety" section of our
                            presentation PPT, incorporating
                            more engaging reflections on genetically modified plants. This became part of our efforts in
                            sharing knowledge, with the
                            goal of reaching a wider audience.</p>
                        <p>Our target audience includes plant lovers, individuals aged 18-30 experiencing stress or mild
                            anxiety, and people
                            interested in innovative products. To better understand the needs of these groups and
                            provide effective educational
                            outreach, we consulted with Dr. Zhong Yi, a psychiatrist from Hong Kong’s Castle Peak
                            Hospital and a PhD in Public
                            Health from the University of Hong Kong. This collaboration helped deepen our understanding
                            of how innovative projects
                            like glowing plants can inspire curiosity and provide a unique solution to stress relief.
                        </p>
                        <p>Our goal is to raise awareness about the benefits of bioluminescent plants and engage these
                            specific audiences. While
                            our role may simply be to introduce this idea, even small steps can lead to greater societal
                            impacts in the future.
                            Taking action, no matter how small, contributes to a larger effort of bringing together
                            science, innovation, and
                            well-being.</p>

                    <h3>Tiandong Middle School</h3>
                    <div style="text-align: left;">
                        <p>We have now accumulated a wealth of knowledge, and our mission has always been to pass it on.
                            The question is, where do
                            we begin? In the end, we chose to conduct our presentation at Tiandong Middle School in
                            Shenzhen. The students there
                            have a strong interest in biology, so we decided to share all the knowledge we had about
                            synthetic biology with these
                            young minds, full of potential. We wanted to ask them how they perceive synthetic biology,
                            what impressions they had
                            after our presentation, and whether anyone aspired to participate in the iGEM competition in
                            the future, dedicating
                            themselves to synthetic biology for a lifetime.</p>
                        <div style="text-align: left; color: #a8f900;">
                            <p><b style="color: #a8f900;">1. Introduction to Synthetic Biology and the iGEM
                                    Competition:</b>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Liu Chengcheng began by explaining the core of synthetic biology: "The essence of synthetic
                            biology lies in surpassing
                            the limitations of natural evolution in traditional biology, transforming cells into highly
                            efficient tools that serve
                            humanity. This field revolves around the 'artificial design and writing of genomes,' using
                            engineering methods to
                            construct biological components or modules to achieve specific functions and synthesize
                            products."</p>
                        <p>To make this concept easier for middle school students to grasp, Chengcheng cleverly used the
                            analogy of building with
                            LEGO blocks: "Imagine synthetic biology as playing with LEGO. In the world of LEGO, you can
                            choose different blocks to
                            build the model you want. In synthetic biology, scientists are like LEGO builders, using
                            carefully selected biological
                            components as building blocks. Through innovative design and precise combination, they
                            create new biological systems
                            that can perform specific tasks."</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img class="text_img"
                                src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5218/image/static/images/education/7.png" alt="s6">
                        </figure>
                        <p>Chengcheng also mentioned the students' upcoming lessons in circuit design during their
                            physics class in the second
                            year: "Soon, in your physics class, you will learn how to design circuits. In circuit
                            design, we use various electronic
                            components like resistors and capacitors, which are the 'parts' of a circuit. By combining
                            them in different ways, we
                            can make the circuit perform different tasks. Similarly, in synthetic biology, we select and
                            combine biological
                            components to build biological systems with specific functions." This analogy was meant to
                            spark students' interest in
                            synthetic biology and build their confidence in potentially joining scientific research in
                            the future.</p>

                        <p>Next, to give students a better understanding of and involvement in the iGEM project, we
                            introduced iGEM through videos
                            and images. Judging by the students' attentive expressions, it was clear that they
                            recognized and were inspired by the
                            iGEM project.</p>

                        <p>Our target audience includes middle school students who are interested in biology but have
                            little to no knowledge of
                            synthetic biology. The main goals of our project were to raise awareness about the
                            importance of mental health and
                            well-being, and to educate students on how our product could contribute to a more inclusive
                            society. Specifically, we
                            wanted to address the social stigmas surrounding mental health, particularly within Eastern
                            and Chinese cultures.</p>
                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                        <p>As a team, we carefully considered how our bioluminescent plant product could positively
                            impact society. We identified
                            people experiencing mental health challenges as a key group, aiming to create an environment
                            where they could openly
                            discuss and seek support for their mental health needs. However, we understand that cultural
                            stigmas in Eastern
                            societies might present barriers to inclusivity. Thus, we focused on educating students and
                            raising awareness about
                            mental health, hoping to dismantle stereotypes and encourage more open discussions about
                            well-being.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>To accomplish these objectives, we prepared detailed materials, including engaging slideshows
                            that highlighted the
                            importance of inclusivity. We discussed the struggles faced by individuals with mental
                            health challenges, such as social
                            stigma, lack of access to resources, and physical limitations, and explained how our glowing
                            plant could address some of
                            these issues. For example, our plant serves as an affordable, one-time purchase alternative
                            to expensive medications or
                            professional treatments, making it accessible to a broader audience.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>We also outlined the steps our team took to promote inclusivity, such as consulting with
                            health professionals and
                            interacting with our target audience. By openly discussing mental health with the students,
                            we aimed to raise awareness,
                            foster inclusivity, and educate them about the product. Additionally, we emphasized the
                            broader importance of creating a
                            more inclusive environment, which could lead to a more open and collaborative community.
                            Through these efforts, we hoped
                            to not only teach students about synthetic biology and mental health but also inspire them
                            to think about how science
                            can contribute to building a more compassionate and inclusive society.</p>

                        <p>Through the excellent presentations by Liu Chengcheng and Xu Jinghan, the students' interest
                            in synthetic biology and
                            glowing plants was fully ignited. Following this, Long Yuxiang guided the students on a deep
                            exploration of glowing
                            plants, covering their history, technical principles, biosafety, project outcomes, and
                            future prospects. Together, they
                            journeyed through this vast sea of knowledge filled with limitless possibilities.</p>
                        <p>Long Yuxiang’s introduction not only deepened the students’ understanding of glowing plants
                            but also fueled their
                            excitement and anticipation for the future of synthetic biology, opening the door to future
                            scientific exploration.</p>

                        <p>When discussing biosafety, Long Yuxiang interacted with the students regarding the biosafety
                            issues of genetically
                            modified plants. He compared biosafety to the importance of ensuring a stable foundation
                            when building skyscrapers,
                            emphasizing the necessity of ensuring the safe application of new technologies. The
                            atmosphere was lively, with students
                            actively participating in discussions, asking questions, and reflecting on how to advance
                            science while ensuring safety.</p>
                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                        <p>After discussing biosafety, we showcased our project results through videos. When presenting
                            the game “Genetically
                            Modified Plants vs. Zombies,” the atmosphere reached a climax, as students expressed their
                            excitement about learning
                            synthetic biology through gaming. This fun and educational method greatly stimulated their
                            interest, allowing them to
                            absorb knowledge in a relaxed and enjoyable environment.</p>
                        <p>Finally, we and the students looked ahead at the future of glowing plants from various
                            perspectives, including
                            education, psychotherapy, and aesthetics. Together, we envisioned a world full of
                            possibilities, where glowing plants
                            not only beautify the environment but also serve as educational tools and even as a form of
                            therapy to bring emotional
                            comfort. This exchange not only enhanced the students' understanding of synthetic biology
                            but also opened their minds to
                            the exciting future of technology.</p>
                        <p>During the presentation, students gained a lot of knowledge, but they also had many
                            questions. In the Q&A session that
                            followed, they eagerly voiced their inquiries. Our team sent representatives to answer each
                            question patiently and
                            thoroughly, ensuring that every student left satisfied. This interaction not only deepened
                            their understanding of
                            synthetic biology but also ignited their enthusiasm for future scientific research.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Some of the key questions asked by students were as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Do glowing plants produce harmful substances when they emit light?</p>
                        <p>The team answered: No. To address the concern about whether genetically modified fungi-based
                            glowing plants produce
                            harmful substances, several points were discussed:</p>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                            <li style="font-size: clamp(0.5rem, 1.25vw, 1rem); ">Light Emission Mechanism: Glowing
                                plants emit light through a genetic modification that introduces the genes for
                                luciferase and the pathway for synthesizing luciferin into the plant. During
                                bioluminescence, luciferin is oxidized by
                                luciferase, releasing light without producing toxic byproducts.
                            </li>
                            <li style="font-size: clamp(0.5rem, 1.25vw, 1rem); ">Safety Evaluation: During the
                                development of genetically modified plants, strict safety evaluations are conducted to
                                assess potential risks to human health and the environment.
                            </li>
                            <li style="font-size: clamp(0.5rem, 1.25vw, 1rem); ">Gene Source: If the glowing genes
                                come from fungi, the bioluminescent mechanism is already proven to be safe in
                                nature. We select genes that have been shown to be harmless in their natural settings.
                            </li>
                            <li style="font-size: clamp(0.5rem, 1.25vw, 1rem); ">Long-term Monitoring: Even with this
                                assurance, the long-term environmental behavior of genetically modified plants
                                and their potential ecological impact must be continuously monitored. In conclusion,
                                based on current research and
                                evaluations, glowing plants using luciferase and luciferin pathways are unlikely to
                                produce harmful substances. However,
                                to ensure safety, scientists conduct rigorous tests in both labs and field trials.

                        <p>2. Why does the government promote genetically modified (GM) technology, but restricts its
                            commercialization?</p>
                        <p>The team explained: The promotion of GM technology by the government does not contradict the
                            regulations around GM product
                            commercialization. Although GM technology research is encouraged, commercialization still
                            requires compliance with
                            strict regulations and review processes. Several key points explain why the government
                            promotes GM technology while
                            regulating GM product sales:</p>

                            </li>
                            <li style="font-size: clamp(0.5rem, 1.25vw, 1rem); ">Public Acceptance: While GM technology
                                is widely accepted in the scientific community, public opinion is divided.
                                Governments may take a cautious approach to maintain public trust by ensuring thorough
                                verification before market
                                release.

                            <li style="font-size: clamp(0.5rem, 1.25vw, 1rem); ">Market Regulation: Governments
                                establish laws to regulate the production and sale of GM products, ensuring fair
                                competition and market order. This often includes labeling systems so consumers can make
                                informed choices.</li>
                            <li style="font-size: clamp(0.5rem, 1.25vw, 1rem); ">International Standards: Global
                                standards and regulations for GM products vary. National policies must align with
                                these standards to facilitate international trade and cooperation.
                            </li>
                            <li style="font-size: clamp(0.5rem, 1.25vw, 1rem); ">Long-term Impact: The long-term
                                effects of GM technology, especially on ecosystems and genetic diversity, are still
                                under research. Governments may take a more prudent stance to prevent potential negative
                                impacts. In summary, while the
                                government supports the development of GM technology, strict regulations are needed for
                                commercialization to ensure
                                safety, protect the environment, and promote healthy market development.

                        <p>These questions addressed the challenges we face in advancing our project and highlighted key
                            areas of public concern,
                            guiding our research direction. Jin Fan, Zi Ye, and Yi Han answered the students' questions
                            from both theoretical (dry
                            lab) and practical (wet lab) perspectives. They explained the bioluminescence mechanisms,
                            the latest advances in GM
                            technology, and the potential of glowing plants in mental therapy. The enthusiastic feedback
                            from the audience further
                            confirmed the novelty and appeal of our glowing plant concept, strengthening our confidence

                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <p>The event was largely successful, as evidenced by the positive feedback from students. The
                            presentations were
                            well-received, achieving their goal of generating interest in synthetic biology and glowing
                            plants. Students not only
                            engaged with the material but also showed a clear level of understanding. Their active
                            participation during the Q&A
                            session, where they asked insightful questions and provided feedback, demonstrated that they
                            had listened carefully and
                            thought critically about the topics presented. This indicated a successful two-way exchange
                            of knowledge.</p>
                        <p>However, there were some areas for improvement. Communication within the team was sometimes
                            lacking, leading to
                            insufficient preparation of materials like posters and souvenirs. Additionally, some team
                            members did not have a deep
                            enough understanding of the project, which affected their ability to provide thorough
                            answers during the Q&A session.
                            Improving spontaneous response skills during live interactions would enhance future events.
                            Lastly, while the topic of
                            glowing plants was well presented, there could have been a deeper exploration of their
                            future applications to provide
                            more comprehensive guidance to the students.</p>

                    <h3>X-Challenge Gallery Walk</h3>
                    <div style="text-align: left;">
                        <p>While our presentations have undoubtedly piqued the interest of middle school students in
                            synthetic biology, we
                            recognized that the future audience for PetalGlow extends beyond students experiencing
                            anxiety. We were eager to
                            understand how the general public might perceive and value our product once it officially
                            enters the market. More
                            importantly, we saw an opportunity to use this as a platform to introduce synthetic biology
                            and glowing plants to a
                            broader audience, thereby increasing public awareness and interest in cutting-edge
                            technologies.</p>
                        <p>At this time, we learned about the "2024 X-Challenge Disruptive Innovation Youth Camp" hosted
                            by Shenzhen Zero One
                            Academy. We decided to participate in the Gallery Walk activity, where we could explore
                            current research directions in
                            synthetic biology and engage in discussions. This event provided our team with a perfect
                            opportunity to showcase our
                            project, exchange ideas, and gain valuable feedback from peers and experts alike.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>We participated in the Gallery Walk at the youth camp, where we observed the project
                            presentations from the other
                            participants. During these exchanges, we gained insights into their research directions and
                            were inspired by the
                            imaginative ideas from the high school students. After visiting all the booths, we realized
                            that there was a noticeable
                            lack of representation in biology, especially in synthetic biology. To address this gap and
                            further promote the
                            advancements in synthetic biology among students, our mentors arranged for us to set up a
                            booth in the biology section
                            featuring genetically modified plants.</p>
                        <p>By setting up our display, we quickly immersed ourselves in the academic atmosphere of the
                            Gallery Walk. We shared our
                            posters and project concepts with high school students and passersby, explaining the concept
                            of PetalGlow and the future
                            potential of genetically modified plants. During the presentation, we received many
                            questions about PetalGlow, such as
                            how to enhance the plant’s brightness, how to design controls to compare light intensity,
                            which plants could be made to
                            glow, and whether PetalGlow could be commercialized. These questions were closely related to
                            the challenges we were
                            already addressing in our project, providing us with valuable insights into the public's
                            interests and concerns, which
                            helped to further refine our research direction.</p>

                        <p>The event reached its peak when our team leader guided everyone through a comprehensive
                            presentation of our project’s
                            concept, experimental progress, product prospects, and future directions. This allowed the
                            audience to gain a deeper
                            understanding of our project. The enthusiastic feedback from the audience confirmed the
                            novelty and appeal of the
                            PetalGlow concept, strengthening our belief in the practical value of our research. It also
                            inspired the students of
                            Zero One Academy in their own research fields. Members of the Track 5 team from the 2023
                            summer school, Chen Tanghao and
                            Jin Borui, extended the conversation with us by sharing their work on glowing plants from
                            the previous year, which
                            helped us further expand our project’s direction.</p>

                        <p>We also gained inspiration for creating a game to promote and market our project.
                            Incorporating PetalGlow into a game
                            had been an idea we wanted to pursue, but we were unsure of how to proceed. Through the
                            Track 6 "Biological Interaction
                            Game" session, where students created a slime mold-themed game, we learned about the game
                            development process and the
                            expected outcomes. This provided us with valuable references for creating our own game. We
                            also realized that using
                            games could significantly capture the audience’s attention and boost the visibility of our
                            product, helping to introduce
                            the PetalGlow concept to a wider audience.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>1. We gained insights into other biology-related research topics and progress, which helped
                            us clarify the next steps in
                            our research, particularly focusing on enhancing brightness and exploring different types of
                            glowing plants.</p>
                        <p>2. We successfully promoted PetalGlow and gathered data on its acceptance among students,
                            which helped us understand the
                            public’s main expectations and concerns. We learned that PetalGlow has great market
                            potential, though ensuring the
                            safety of the product is paramount.</p>
                        <p>3. We explored the feasibility of using a game as a tool for promoting the project, which
                            provided a valuable reference
                            model for our game design.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>During this event, we systematically introduced the concept of PetalGlow, our experimental
                            progress, product prospects,
                            and future directions. We were pleasantly surprised by the overwhelmingly positive feedback
                            from the audience, which
                            even sparked ideas for further research and integration with synthetic biology in their own
                            fields. After our
                            presentation, members of the Track 5 team from the 2023 summer school extended the
                            conversation with us, sharing their
                            previous work on glowing plants, which led to further discussions and collaboration. The
                            strong audience interest
                            confirmed the novelty and appeal of PetalGlow, reinforcing our confidence in the practical
                            value of our research. This
                            experience demonstrated that we had effectively introduced synthetic biology and glowing
                            plants to a wider audience,
                            successfully expanding public knowledge and awareness.</p>

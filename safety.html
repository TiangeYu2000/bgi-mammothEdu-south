                    <div style="text-align: left;">
                        <p>Safety is a critical topic in synthetic biology and an essential factor that must be
                            considered in any work or product.
                            The 'Work Safety Law of the People's Republic of China' clearly stipulates that our
                            country's safety management work
                            must adhere to the principle of 'safety first, prevention foremost, and comprehensive
                            management.' In all production
                            processes, protecting human life must be the top priority. Our project aims to create a
                            controllable glowing plant pet
                            as a solution to help people alleviate anxiety in daily life. Therefore, we have considered
                            various potential impacts on
                            humans and the environment during the creation of this product. This year, we analyzed the
                            risks that may arise
                            throughout the project and outlined the following details.</p>

                            iGEM safety form. You are welcome to view the detailed safety form about our project

                    <h3>Safe Project Design</h3>
                    <div style="text-align: left;">
                        <p>In designing our safety protocols, since we will be using genetically modified glowing
                            tobacco (FBP-T2 line/FBP-22 line)
                            as the plant chassis for related research, we have implemented a series of measures to
                            ensure the safety of the
                            experiments and minimize risks. Below are the specific decisions we made in the design
                            process:</p>
                        <div style="text-align: left; color: #a8f900;">
                            <p><b style="color: #a8f900;">Biosafety and Bioethics</b>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <p>During the course of the project, we received training on bioethics and safety, which
                            allowed us to revisit and gain a
                            deeper understanding of ethical principles. By studying and analyzing various ethical
                            cases, we formulated the following
                            guidelines.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img class="text_img"

                            <figcaption>
                                <p>Figure1: Bioethics and Safety Training Page</p>
                            </figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>1. Strict Selection of Non-pathogenic Chassis:</p>
                        <p>We chose to use non-pathogenic, commercially available Escherichia coli TOP10 and
                            Agrobacterium GV3101 as microbial
                            vectors to construct the chassis, and selected the commonly used model plant Nicotiana
                            benthamiana as the plant chassis
                            for functional validation. This ensures that no health risks are posed to humans,
                            animals, or plants during the
                            experimental process.</p>
                        <p>2. Selection of Components that Do Not Harm Humans, Animals, or Plants:</p>
                        <p>When selecting the vector backbone, we chose the pCAMBIA1300 backbone, which is free of any
                            harmful effects. Components
                            added to this backbone, such as plant promoters, terminators, the resistance marker gene
                            Kan, and reporter genes like
                            GFP/GUS, have all been widely used and are harmless to humans and the environment.</p>
                        <p>3. Substitute Hazardous Materials with Safer Alternatives:</p>
                        <p>In the validation experiments, we replaced traditional hazardous materials with safer
                            alternatives commonly available in
                            the market. For example, we used non-toxic or low-toxicity nucleic acid dyes instead of the
                            cell-permeable ethidium
                            bromide (EB) dye, and weak acid solutions to dissolve acetylacetone instead of using the
                            toxic DMSO solvent.</p>

                            <p><b style="color: #a8f900;">Agricultural Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) Biosafety</b>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <p>According to the 'Regulations on the Safety Assessment and Management of Agricultural
                            Genetically Modified Organisms,'
                            the microorganisms TOP10 and GV3101, the genetically modified plant FBP-T2 line, and future
                            transgenic products we study
                            are classified as Biosafety Level I (non-dangerous), indicating no risk to the environment
                            or humans. Therefore, in
                            strict compliance with national and international laws, regulations, and standards, we
                            successfully applied for and
                            utilized the standard genetically modified plant research laboratory at the Shenzhen BGI
                            Research Institute of Life
                            Sciences. We have implemented the following safety measures:</p>
                        <p>1. Safe Genetic Modification Methods:</p>
                        <p>We use transient Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, which offers advantages such as no
                            permanent genetic
                            modification and low environmental risk. This method is simple, efficient, and does not
                            require complex tissue culture
                            and regeneration processes, thereby reducing risks of pathogen spread, contamination, and
                            cross-contamination in the
                            laboratory environment. During the transient transformation of tobacco leaves, plant
                            materials do not require additional
                            experimental treatments, so the injection operations are performed in a dedicated isolation
                            chamber within the
                            transgenic isolation climate room. After the experiment, thorough disinfection is conducted
                            immediately to prevent any
                            risk of spread and cross-contamination.</p>
                        <p>2. Controlled Enviroment Chamber Management:</p>
                        <p>The laboratory has separate controlled environment chambers for non-transgenic and transgenic
                            materials, including areas
                            for tissue culture, preparation, inoculation, washing and disinfection, sterilization, waste
                            sterilization, and waste
                            storage. Our transgenic tobacco FBP-T2 line materials are cultivated in a specific
                            transgenic chamber, with detailed
                            records maintained for material and personnel access to ensure that materials are not lost
                            and genes do not escape.
                            Non-transgenic materials such as Arabidopsis, periwinkle, ornamental roses, and cherry
                            tomatoes are managed in standard
                            climate chambers, completely isolated from transgenic materials. During tobacco leaf
                            injection experiments, operations
                            are conducted in a designated sample inoculation area, and thorough disinfection of the area
                            is performed after the
                            experiment.</p>

                        <p>Data Security: Ensure that all data and information related to genetically modified plants
                            are protected in accordance
                            with relevant laws and regulations to prevent data leakage and misuse.</p>
                        <p>Transparency: Disclose relevant information about genetically modified plant projects to

                        <p>When transferring genetically modified plant materials for formaldehyde treatment, in
                            addition to pre-registration and
                            reporting procedures, we use standardized enclosed equipment for transport to ensure that
                            the transgenic plants do not
                            come into contact with the natural environment and are physically isolated for protection.

                        <p>Team iGEM14_Valencia_UpV 2014 submitted two biosafety devices for plants, <a class="link"
                                href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1554004">BBa_K1554004</a> and
                            <a class="link" href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1554005">BBa_K1554005</a>, which
                            specifically express barnase in anthers under the regulation of the TA29 tapetum-specific
                            promoter to make the plants
                            infertile. This will avoid the dispersion of the plant's genetic material in the
                            environment.
                            In the future, we aim to
                            apply these two modules to the design of FBP enhanced plants for strict biosafety
                            implementation.

                        <p>6. Public Opinion Survey:</p>
                        <p>We have concerns about the use of genetically modified plants, as this topic may spark public
                            controversy. As part of
                            our human practice, we conducted a survey to gather public opinions on the use of genetic
                            modification and incorporated
                            these findings into our public outreach efforts. This approach has received positive
                            feedback from the public during the
                            outreach activities we participated in, aiming to minimize concerns and foster discussion on
                            the topic.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>We strictly adhere to local laws, regulations, rules, and guidelines, carefully managing the
                            ways in which the project
                            interacts with humans, as well as the collection and analysis of information. The project
                            does not involve any human
                            biomedical samples. Regarding the connection between plants and humans, we primarily focus
                            on the following two aspects:</p>
                        <p>1. Informed Consent and Ethical Review:</p>
                        <p>Informaed Consnet: Our project research does not involve
                            any human subjects. All team members have provided informed consent and are fully
                            aware of the research
                            objectives, procedures, potential risks, and benefits.</p>
                        <p>Ethical Review: All research projects have undergone rigorous review and approval by the BGI
                            Ethics Committee to ensure compliance with
                            ethical and legal requirements.</p>
                        <p>2. Regulatory Compliance:</p>
                        <p>Laws and Regulations: Ensure that all project experiments strictly comply with relevant
                            national and international laws, regulations, and
                            standards.</p>
                        <p>Safety Certification: Before the commercialization of genetically modified plants, obtain the
                            necessary safety certifications and approvals.
                            Currently, our materials are not involved in commercialization.</p>

                            <p><b style="color: #a8f900;">Environmental Samples Policy</b>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <p>1. Environmental Impact Assessment:</p>
                        <p>Since the inherent hazard levels of the genetically modified plants or microorganisms we work
                            with are very low, and the
                            research is conducted in a relatively enclosed environment with proper handling before and
                            after experiments, we ensure
                            that the research process does not have a negative impact on the environment. All research
                            activities comply with
                            environmental protection regulations and standards.</p>
                        <p>2. Safe Collection of Environmental Samples:</p>
                        <p>When taking samples, we only collect plant tissues from artificially cultivated plants in the
                            climate chamber for RNA or
                            DNA extraction. During the process, we follow strict safety procedures to ensure that the
                            sampling does not cause
                            environmental contamination or damage. All sampling equipment and containers are disinfected
                            and sterilized to avoid
                            cross-contamination.</p>
                        <p>3. Sample Transport and Storage:</p>
                        <p>Except for plant materials that require short-distance transportation for formaldehyde
                            treatment, no other samples
                            involve outdoor transportation. Materials such as RNA, DNA, plasmids, E. coli, and
                            Agrobacterium are involved in
                            storage. These materials, especially plant materials, are strictly regulated and not taken
                            out of the laboratory. They
                            are transported in standardized enclosed equipment to a fume hood in the climate chamber
                            inoculation area for
                            processing. Other samples are stored in laboratory-grade refrigerators to prevent sample
                            degradation or contamination,
                            ensuring their integrity and safety.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Before entering the laboratory, we underwent safety training and foundational
                            experimental knowledge with the staff of
                            BGI Research Institute. This included simulations and practical skills for different
                            laboratory activities, safety
                            knowledge and case studies, and proper use of laboratory equipment. We were granted
                            access only after passing the
                            required assessment.</p>
                        <p>During this period, we strictly adhered to the Research Institute's internal 'Laboratory
                            Safety Management Regulations'
                            while conducting our projects. To ensure that team members work in a safer laboratory
                            environment, we also complied with
                            the iGEM competition's safety and security rules.</p>
                        <p>To avoid accidents or damage, we implemented appropriate safety measures during
                            experiments, such as wearing gloves,
                            masks, laboratory coats, and safety goggles when necessary, to protect against
                            biological and non-biological hazards.</p>

                        <p>At the same time, we adhere to a system of mutual supervision by at least two people.
                            After completing daily
                            experiments, we check the laboratory safety and standardize the behavior of laboratory
                            team members. Experienced mentors
                            also provide guidance and regulations on experimental operations and safety management
                            to ensure that team members
                            conduct experiments smoothly in a safer laboratory environment.</p>

                            appropriate safety and
                            emergency equipment, such as biosafety cabinets, emergency eyewash stations, incubators,
                            sterilization devices, sinks,
                            storage cabinets, electrical equipment, and fire-fighting equipment.</p>
                        <p>Reagents and chemicals are categorized and stored accordingly. Flammable and explosive
                            chemicals (such as anhydrous
                            ethanol, isopropanol, sodium hypochlorite, formaldehyde) are kept in dedicated storage
                            cabinets with warnings and are
                            locked with dual-person management. We first register and report when using these reagents,
                            and the required amount is
                            retrieved by the administrator. The reagents are then used in a designated fume hood for
                            safe experimentation.</p>
                        <p>For specialized equipment (such as autoclaves for high temperature and pressure), we follow
                            regulations by registering

                        <p>Additionally, we place a special emphasis on the safety of microbiological experiments. This
                            year, we use low-risk
                            microorganisms, such as E. coli TOP10 and Agrobacterium GV3101, for basic biological
                            experiments. For working with
                            low-risk organisms, we conduct most experiments in a clean bench or biological safety
                            cabinet to prevent aerosol
                            generation. For products related to transgenic plants, we ensure that they are not
                            cultivated in unintended locations
                            and implement specific biological containment and isolation measures according to
                            regulations to limit their spread. For
                            waste materials related to microbiological experiments and transgenic plants, we first use
                            chemical disinfectants for
                            initial decontamination, followed by thorough sterilization using high-temperature and
                            high-pressure methods in a
                            designated waste sterilization area. The treated waste is then disposed of in specific bins

                            ensure swift and effective
                            handling of safety incidents. During experiments, we have also developed emergency response
                            procedures for laboratory
                            safety incidents based on training, as outlined below:</p>
                        <p>1. Stop the experiment immediately: In the event of a safety incident, all experimental
                            operations should be stopped immediately to ensure that the
                            experimental equipment is in a safe state.</p>
                        <p>2. Assess the circumstances of the accident: Quickly assess the type and severity of the
                            incident, including whether it involves chemical spills, fire, injuries,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>3. Notify relevant personnel: Immediately notify the laboratory supervisor and safety
                            personnel to report the incident.</p>
                        <p>4. Evacuate personnel: Depending on the severity of the incident, evacuate all personnel from
                            the laboratory immediately if necessary, ensuring
                            they are kept away from the danger zone.</p>
                        <p>5. Use emergency equipment: use the emergency equipment provided in the laboraatory according
                            to the type of incident. For example:</p>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                            <li style="font-size: clamp(0.5rem, 1.25vw, 1rem); ">Chemical spill: Use absorbent materials
                                or a spill response kit to handle the situation.
                            </li>
                            <li style="font-size: clamp(0.5rem, 1.25vw, 1rem); ">Fire: Use a fire extinguisher or fire
                                blanket to extinguish the source of the fire.
                            </li>
                            <li style="font-size: clamp(0.5rem, 1.25vw, 1rem); ">Luciferase (Luz):
                                Catalyzes the oxidation of fungal luciferin,
                                resulting in
                                light emission.
                            </li>
                            <li style="font-size: clamp(0.5rem, 1.25vw, 1rem); ">Injury: Use a first aid kit for initial
                                treatment and call for emergency assistance as needed.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>6. Ventilation and isolation: If there is a leak of toxic or irritating gases, the
                            laboratory's negative pressure exhaust system should be activated
                            immediately to ensure air circulation and isolate the contaminated area.</p>
                        <p>7. Cleaning and disinfection: After handling the incident, the affected area should be
                            thoroughly cleaned and disinfected to ensure that no residual
                            contaminants are left behind.</p>
                        <p>8. Documentation and reporting: Carefully record the time, location, cause, response process,
                            and outcome of the incident, and submit an incident report
                            to the relevant departments.</p>
                        <p>9. Incident analysis and improvement: Analyze the incident to identify its causes, develop
                            improvement measures, and prevent similar incidents from occurring
                            again.</p>
                        <p>We equip the laboratory with the necessary safety equipment and personal protective gear, and
                            conduct regular safety
                            training and emergency drills, either periodically or as organized by the research
                            institute, to ensure that all team
                            members are familiar with emergency procedures and the use of equipment.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Fortunately, we have focused on safety training and management, learning various key safety
                            points and strictly adhering
                            to the laboratory's rules and regulations to standardize experimental procedures. During
                            this time, no safety hazards or
                            incidents, large or small, have occurred. We consistently wear lab coats and gloves in the
                            laboratory, disinfect our
                            hands before leaving, and leave all supplies and products in the lab without taking them
                            outside. We also avoid touching
                            public areas with our gloved hands to prevent cross-contamination. This effectively reduces
                            potential risks to public
                            safety and health.</p>

                        <p>Through the integrated implementation of these design decisions and safety measures, we have
                            minimized the potential
                            risks present during the experimental process, ensuring the safety and reliability of the
                            project, while also fully
                            protecting the safety of both human and public environments.</p>
